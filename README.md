**React Dives**
---------
React Dives is a web application that allows users to keep a record of all of their scuba diving logs in one place. This app gives users full CRUD functionality over their logs. Users only have to sign in with their Google credentials to start logging their dives.   

**Motivation**
---------
As a diver I wanted a centralized place to keep all of my dive logs because every time I wanted to look up a specific log I would have to try to find it among different log books. 

**Tech Used**
---------
React | Redux | Thunk | Axios | Lodash | Bootstrap
