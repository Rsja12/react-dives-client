**React Dives**
---------
React Dives is a web application that allows users to keep a record of all of their scuba diving logs in one place. This app gives users full CRUD functionality over their logs. Users only have to sign in with their Google credentials to start logging their dives.   

**Motivation**
---------
As a diver I wanted a centralized place to keep all of my dive logs because every time I wanted to look up a specific log I would have to try to find it among different log books. 

**Tech Used**
---------
React | Redux | Thunk | Axios | Lodash | Bootstrap

**Installation**
---------
This is only the frontend side of this project. I'm using JSON Server to hold data at the moment while I continue to play around with the frontend. To install this project on your machine you can clone down this repo cd into it and run `npm install` followed by `yarn start`. Then, go to https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server and follow the directions for setting up a very quick fake REST API. Once all that is done, start your JSON Server and you should be good to go!
